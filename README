# LiteDesk

Peppermint.sh no longer appears to be maintained and was left in an unusable state. I would contribute but I have no desire to learn Typescript as a Network Engineer. Thus LiteDesk.

It is barebones and simple. No Databases. I don't like them. User Accounts and Tickets databases are json files for simplicity.

You should deploy LiteDesk behind Cloudflare Tunnels or Caddy.

## Project Setup

LiteDesk is a python3.12 Flask project that by default runs at ```http://127.0.0.1:5000```.

```shell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
