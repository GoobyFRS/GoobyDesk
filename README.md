## What is GoobyDesk

GoobyDesk is a Python3, Flask-based web application. Leverages Cloudflare Turnstile for Anti-Spam/Brute force protection.

- By default, the Flask app will run at ```http://127.0.0.1:5000``` during local development.
- Production instances should be ran behind a Python3 WSGI server such as [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).
- Production Gunicorn instances should be ran behind a Reverse Proxy such as [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/).
