# CHANGELOG

**Jan.21.2025-1:** Initial email now sends an HTML template including TKT_ID, Status, and the user provided notes as a reminder.

**Jan.20.2025-3:** locally stored GoobyFRS Branding, removing dependancy on my personal Object Storage. Disabing Debug mode out of the box for a leaner runtime.

**Jan.20.2025-2:** Morning patch - Close Ticket button design matches my standards. Code has been further commented.

**Jan.20.2025-1:** Basic implementation for closing tickets. Not production ready. Bedtime.

**Jan.18.2025-1:** Secure cookie encoding. Add gunicorn to dependancies.
